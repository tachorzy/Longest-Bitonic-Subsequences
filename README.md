# Longest-Bitonic-Subsequences
COSC 3320 HW3 Programming Challenge, Professor Wu

Call a sequence X[1..n] of numbers bitonic if there is an index i with 1 < i < n, such that the prefix X[1..i] is increasing and the suffix X [i .. n] is decreasing. Describe an efficient algorithm to compute the length of the longest bitonic subsequence of an arbitrary array X of integers.

Input format: first line is a single number n, the following line consists of n numbers that is the array A[1..n]
